# Clustering on Wheat kernels
*Clustering on Wheat kernels* is a project that represents several methods of Clustering on a dataset of *Wheat kernels*. 

Clustering methods used:
* *K-Means.*
* *EM.*
* *DBSCAN.*
* *Deep Learning Clustering*

The `EDA` file shows the how the data was explored.

## Getting Started

The code is written in python but some files need to be opened up in Jupyter. To start, clone the present repository into your local machine. If you're unaware of how to achieve this, please become familiar with the mechanisms of [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) repositories.

```
git clone https://github.com/soaresdominic/ClusterAnalysis.git
```

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org)

Get jupyter to open the .ipynb, python notebooks [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org)

Every script should be easy to run, after installing the necessary libraries (as found at the start of each script).

Start an issue for any problems setting up.
